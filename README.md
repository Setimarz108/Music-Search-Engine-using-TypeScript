# Music-Search-Engine-using-TypeScript.

Fulfill the requirements and try to implement as best as you can typings and interfaces.

 
ðŸ“š API Docs:

The endpoint for performing a search looks like this:

https://striveschool-api.herokuapp.com/api/deezer/search?q=whatever

Use the id property of any resulting track to fetch detail information with

https://striveschool-api.herokuapp.com/api/deezer/track/:id

 
TASKS:

    Implement a nice main page with an input field for the search, and show here also the search results.
    Clicking on any result should bring the user on a detail page, which will fetch the data for that particular track. Show on this detail page information you consider relevant about the song (i.e. title, album, duration ecc.)
