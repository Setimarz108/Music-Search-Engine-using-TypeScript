# Music-Search-Engine-using-TypeScript

Fulfill the requirements and try to implement as best as you can typings and interfaces.
TASKS:

    Implement a nice main page with an input field for the search, and show here also the search results.
    Clicking on any result should bring the user on a detail page, which will fetch the data for that particular track. Show on this detail page information you consider relevant about the song (i.e. title, album, duration ecc.)
